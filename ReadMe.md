Welcome to Tic Tac Doh!!!

The rules of the game are simple:

Click on an open spot on the gameboard and your charachter will appear.  If you get three in a row then you are the winner! Upon winning the loser will go first the next game.  If the result is a tie (or cats game) then press the start over button and Bender will go first the next game. As long as you don't reset your game will keep score for both players recording their wins.  

--HTML--

This is the basic set up of the design.  Created the different sections that each part of the page occupys.  Using the Pure CSS grid system I was able to space the page out properly.  I also reset the CSS using Pure's CSS reset.

--CSS--

This is where the styling takes place.  I am linked to the reset and grid CSS first, and then my Main.css is where all of my styling comes in.

--JS--

Using jQuery to access different elements, this is where the game gets its functionality.  I was able to select a winner if the correct combinations contained the same classes that get added once a player selects and open spot. 

--Bugs--

The site is still not fully responsive and needs some tweeking to make it accessible to phones and tablets.
